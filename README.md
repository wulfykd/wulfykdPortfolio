<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=0 data-line-end=1 ><a id="Hello_0"></a>Hello,</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">My name is Dustin Wulfkuhle. I am 23 years of age and currently in school for computer science. I have a full time job where I do data processing and hope to do programming as an official career. The specific title of the job that I dream about is software engineering. I plan to graduate in May of 2023 and hopefully start my official carrer shortly after.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">Some hobbies of mine include <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-programming">programming</a> fun projects, gaming, and also working on my car. I drive a 2021 Kia Forte GT and have done many projects to it which include a tune, blow-off valve, intake, spark plugs, and coilovers. Below are some pictures of my project. Aside that, I like to play <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/">call of duty</a> or <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">rocket league</a> in my spare time. I would say I was pretty good at rocket league but not so much anymore as I do not play it as much since I do not have as much time being a full time student and working full time. Another hobby of mine or something I enjoy doing is traveling. I have been all over South America as well as visited Canada, Italy, and Japan.</p>
